#Taxonomy
The Taxonomy REST API provides access to the UniProt taxonomy database. The services can be queried with taxonomy identifier(s) to retrieve hierarchical information (children, parent, sibling taxa), taxonomic lineage, relationships between two taxa, and common ancestors of an organism. The services can also be queried with a taxonomy name to find all related information to that node or hierarchical information about its children, parent and sibling nodes.
